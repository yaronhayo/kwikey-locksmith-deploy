We're typically significantly more convenient than dealers. And we're available during operating hours, not just during business hours. Our keys are identical quality to dealer keys, programmed with the same professional equipment."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My key turns hard in the ignition. What's wrong?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This usually indicates a worn ignition cylinder. If ignored, it can leave you stranded when the key stops turning entirely. We can repair or replace your ignition cylinder on-site. Most repairs take about an hour."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My key fob isn't working. Is it just the battery?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Often yes! Key fob batteries typically last a few years. We can test and replace the battery on-site professionally. If the fob itself is damaged or needs reprogramming, we can handle that too without a trip to the dealer."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you work on older vehicles without computer chips?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely! We cut keys for all vehicles, from classic cars to modern ones. Older vehicles with simple keys are actually our most efficient jobs. We can often have you a new key professionally for vehicles from the 1990s and earlier."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I lost all my car keys. Can you still help?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. We can create a new key from scratch for most vehicles. We'll verify ownership, program a new transponder or smart key, and have you driving again. This is much more convenient than towing to a dealership."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you make keys for push-to-start vehicles?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we have the equipment to program smart keys (proximity keys) for most push-to-start vehicles. These keys communicate wirelessly with your car, so programming requires specialized tools we carry in our mobile units."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I get a spare car key made?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Definitely. Getting a spare now is a highly recommended safety measure compared to what you'll experience during an emergency lockout. Plus, programming a spare is simpler and more straightforward when you have a working key to reference."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you program transponder chip keys on-site?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Our technicians use high-end diagnostic equipment to program transponder chips and key fobs on-site. This eliminates the need for expensive dealership towing and provides a faster solution for modern vehicle security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a transponder key and why does it require specialized programming?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A transponder key has a computer chip that communicates with your car's immobilizer system. If the chip signal doesn't match, the car won't start. The chip requires specialized programming equipment and expert configuration to ensure security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you cut a car key using the VIN number?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, our advanced mobile units can cut new car keys directly from the VIN number once ownership is verified.

We install and program both types."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"An employee left with keys. What should I do?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Rekey immediately. We can rekey your entire business professionally and affordably—often in a single visit. With access control systems, you can delete their credential in seconds. Either way, don't wait. Call us today for peace of mind."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does a master key system work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A master key system lets different keys open different doors while one master key opens them all. Perfect for property managers, office buildings, and retail stores. Each employee gets access only to their areas while owners maintain full access."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is panic bar or crash bar hardware?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Panic hardware is the push-bar exit device required by fire code on many commercial doors. It allows immediate emergency exit while remaining secure from the outside. We install, repair, and maintain all types of panic hardware."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are the advantages of a commercial master key system?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A master key system allows business owners to access every door with a single key while restricting specific employees to their designated areas. This enhances internal security and simplifies access management for complexes and office buildings."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you open my commercial safe if I forgot the combination?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we are highly trained safe technicians. We can open most commercial safes without damage using manipulation techniques or specialized tools. We can also change the combination after and provide documentation for your records."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you offer commercial security assessments?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we provide comprehensive security audits for businesses.

Many clients find vulnerabilities they never knew existed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you make car keys for any vehicle?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we can cut and program keys for most makes and models, including transponder keys, smart keys, and key fobs. We work with domestic and foreign vehicles, both new and older models."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you offer after-hours locksmith service for businesses?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we understand businesses don't always operate 9-5. Whether you need an emergency lockout resolved after hours or scheduled lock installation on a Sunday to avoid business disruption, we're available during our extended operating hours for commercial clients."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is there an extra charge for after-hours or weekend service?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We keep our after-hours response transparent. While some companies charge extreme premiums at night, our after-hours diagnostic quotes remain consistent. We'll always provide a transparent diagnostic quote upfront before we start—no surprises when you're already stressed."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What type of lock is recommended for a storefront glass door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We typically recommend Adams Rite or similar storefront locks designed specifically for aluminum-frame glass doors. They're secure, durable, and designed for high-traffic commercial use. We carry parts for most major brands."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My key broke off inside the lock. Can you help?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Broken key extraction is one of our specialties. We use specialized tools to remove the broken piece without damaging your lock. In most cases, we can also cut you a new key on-site so you're not stranded."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you offer commercial locksmith services?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely.

We will drop everything to dispatch the nearest available technician to your location instantly. While you wait, keep the child or pet as calm as possible and stay in direct communication with our dispatch team."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to prove I own the property during a lockout?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, for your protection and ours. We require valid ID matching the address, registration for vehicles, or other proof of residency. This protects you from unauthorized entry. If you're a renter, a lease or utility bill works too."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do while waiting for the locksmith?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Prioritize your safety by staying in a well-lit area or nearby open business. Please avoid attempting forced entry or DIY bypass techniques, as these often lead to structural hardware damage that can complicate the resolution and lead to unnecessary hardware replacement. Have proof of property ownership ready to present to our technician upon arrival. We will maintain communication as our mobile lab transit to your location."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How soon can you respond to an emergency lockout?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Arrival times are subject to location and traffic conditions, but we prioritize emergency lockout requests through a tiered dispatch system. We maintain a network of mobile technicians across the region to ensure a professional response. We will provide an honest arrival estimate during your call and keep you updated throughout the process."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I locked my keys in my running car. Is this an emergency?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes! A running car lockout is our highest priority. We'll prioritize your call to prevent overheating, fuel waste, or carbon monoxide buildup in enclosed spaces. Call us right away and we'll get our nearest tech headed your way."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to make an appointment or can you come now?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both work! For emergencies, we prioritize your call. For scheduled work like lock installation or rekeying, we can book appointments that fit your schedule. Tell us your preference when you call."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you bring hardware with you or do I need to purchase locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our mobile units are stocked with a comprehensive inventory of Grade 1 and Grade 2 locks, deadbolts, and high-security hardware. While we carry components from industry-leading brands for same-day resolution, we can also source specialized hardware to meet your unique architectural or security requirements."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are your locksmiths background checked?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, every technician undergoes a thorough background check before joining our team. We also carry full insurance. You're trusting us with access to your home or business—we take that responsibility seriously."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How soon can you get to me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Arrival times are subject to location, traffic conditions, and current dispatch volume. We prioritize emergency lockout requests and maintain a network of mobile technicians across the region to ensure a professional response. We provide an honest, professional arrival estimate during your initial consultation and maintain active communication as our technicians depart."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you come to my location or do I come to you?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We maintain a fully mobile fleet of professional locksmith laboratories.

Technical rekeying is a relatively quick process per cylinder, while complex automotive programming or high-security hardware installation may require additional time. We provide an honest duration estimate during our initial diagnostic assessment."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are you professionally insured?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes.

This helps us dispatch the right tech with the right tools."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will you damage my lock getting me in?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, our trained technicians use professional non-destructive entry techniques. We have specialized tools and training to unlock doors without damaging your locks, doors, or vehicle."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get an estimate before you come out?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely.

Mention the total number of locks when you call for an accurate multi-lock quote."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What payment methods do you accept?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We accept cash, all major credit cards, and digital payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

If there's an issue, we'll come back and make it right."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I rekey or replace my locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Rekeying is a precision procedure that alters the internal logic of your lock cylinder, rendering old keys useless while maintaining your existing hardware. We recommend replacement only if your hardware is structurally compromised, mechanically fatigued, or if you require an upgrade to high-security or smart-locking platforms."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What are bump-proof or pick-resistant locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"These locks have special pin configurations that defeat common lock-picking techniques. Brands like Medeco and Mul-T-Lock are excellent options. We recommend them for front doors and any entry visible from the street."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I have a deadbolt on my garage entry door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. The door from your garage to your home is the most common break-in point. Once inside the garage, burglars work hidden from view. We recommend a high-quality deadbolt and solid-core door for this entry point."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What grade of deadbolt should I use for my home?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We recommend Grade 1 or Grade 2 deadbolts for residential use. Grade 1 offers the highest security and is what we install on most homes. Grade 3 is builder-grade and adequate for interior doors only. Let us assess your needs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it better to rekey or replace locks in a new home?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Rekeying is often a smart choice for new homeowners, as it changes the internal pins so old keys no longer work. However, if the hardware is damaged or outdated, replacing the entire lock with high-security deadbolts is recommended for maximum protection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"I just bought a new home. Should I change the locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Maintaining 100% key control is the primary objective of any new property acquisition. Because you cannot verify the chain of custody for existing keys—potentially distributed to contractors, real estate agents, or previous associates—we recommend a professional rekey as a Day 1 security priority. This is the most efficient method to ensure your family possesses the only authorized credentials."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you install smart locks on standard residential doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we specialize in retrofitting standard doors with modern smart locks. We can help you choose a compatible system that integrates with your home automation while ensuring the physical installation is secure and professional."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I secure my sliding glass door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Sliding doors are vulnerable points.

We install all of these and can assess your specific door."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are smart locks as secure as traditional deadbolts?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Quality smart locks from brands like Schlage and Yale are just as secure mechanically as traditional locks. They add convenience features like remote access and activity logs. We recommend models with auto-lock and tamper alerts for maximum security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where should I keep spare keys?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Never under the doormat, flowerpot, or fake rock—burglars check these first. Give a spare to a trusted neighbor instead. Smart locks eliminate this worry entirely. We can also install a secure key lockbox that requires a code."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I change locks if I'm renting?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Check your lease first—most landlords allow it if you provide them a copy of the new key. We recommend rekeying rather than replacing so you can give the old keys back when you move. Many landlords appreciate tenants who take security seriously."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you provide locksmith services 24 hours a day?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, we maintain full 24-hour availability to handle lock and key emergencies whenever they occur. Our mobile technicians are strategically stationed to provide rapid assistance day or night, ensuring you're never left stranded."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you integrate access control with my existing doors?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Usually yes.

We'll assess your current hardware and recommend the most effective solution that meets your security needs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are you available on holidays?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We do our best to accommodate emergencies during holidays and extended hours. Our mobile service operates Sunday through Thursday 7AM-10PM and Friday 7AM-4:30PM. We are closed on Saturdays. If you have an urgent lockout during our operating hours on a holiday, give us a call and we'll do everything we can to help."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What areas do you serve?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our mobile service units provide professional coverage across New Castle County, Delaware, and the Greater Philadelphia region, including Chester and Delaware counties. Whether you are in Wilmington, Newark, West Chester, or Media, we bring our specialized equipment directly to your location."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my commercial lockout also triggers the alarm?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We work with you to coordinate with your alarm company before entry. Many clients have us on their authorized list. If needed, we can wait while you contact monitoring to prevent a false alarm response."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you make keys for any car brand?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We service most major brands: Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Hyundai, Kia, and more. Some luxury and exotic vehicles may require dealer involvement, but we can usually handle keys for 95% of cars on the road."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will unlocking my car cause any damage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. We use professional air wedges and long-reach tools designed for car entry without damage. These are the same tools AAA technicians use. Your car will look exactly as it did before we arrived."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What high-security lock brands do you recommend?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We install Medeco, Mul-T-Lock, Abloy, and ASSA. Each has unique strengths. Medeco offers excellent pick and bump resistance. Mul-T-Lock has interactive technology. We'll help you choose based on your specific security needs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you get me in through a window instead of the door?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We prefer to enter through your locked door using professional tools—it's safer and doesn't risk window damage. However, if you have an unlocked window, we can advise you. Our goal is getting you in without any damage."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is my problem the ignition or the starter?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your key turns but nothing happens, it's likely the starter. If the key won't turn or gets stuck, it's the ignition cylinder. We diagnose this on-site and only fix what's actually broken. No guesswork."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are your replacement key fobs OEM or aftermarket?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We offer both options. OEM fobs are identical to what you'd get from the dealership. Aftermarket fobs are high-quality alternatives that provide a similar experience. Both work identically—we'll explain your options when we provide a transparent diagnostic quote."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does lock installation require drilling new holes?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on your door. If replacing an existing lock, usually no new holes are needed. For new installations, we drill precise holes that won't weaken your door. We also check that your door jamb is properly reinforced."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a master key system less secure?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, when properly designed. We use high-quality pins and cylinders that are just as pick-resistant as individual locks. Plus, we can combine master key systems with high-security hardware for maximum protection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How many keys do I get when you rekey my locks?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Standard rekeying includes 2 new keys per lock.

If you have multiple locks, we can key them all alike so one key opens everything."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are your locksmiths background-verified?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, every technician on our team undergoes rigorous multi-stage background verification and carries comprehensive professional insurance. We prioritize your security by ensuring our staff are verified experts in residential, commercial, and automotive lock systems."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is it worth repairing an old lock or should I replace it?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We'll assess your lock and give honest advice. Sometimes a simple repair is all you need. Other times, replacing with a modern lock is the smarter investment. We don't push replacements if repair makes sense."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should my safe be bolted to the floor?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely, for any safe under 750 lbs. Thieves often steal smaller safes to crack later at their leisure. Bolting eliminates this risk. We include professional anchoring in our safe installation service."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do smart locks need WiFi to work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not necessarily. Many smart locks work with Bluetooth for proximity unlocking. WiFi is only needed for remote access when you're away from home. We can recommend the right option based on your needs and existing tech setup."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can you clone my existing transponder key?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For many vehicles, yes.
